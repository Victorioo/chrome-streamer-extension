## YOUR FAVORITE STREAMER EXTENSION.

I was looking for an extension that tells me when my favorite streamer is ON, but I didn't find it then, 
I created it myself. 

## Simply to use it you must:
### 1 -  Create an app on your Twitch Console

Create an application, you can get more information on the twitch developers page.
Get your ClientID and Access Token....

### 2 - Clone the repository 

Clone the repository to have all the files, on your computer, then in the 'popup.js' file, 
you must replace the clientID and accessToken variable with your data

### 3 - Upload your extension

To upload your extension, just drag the folder with the extension in chrome://extensions and you will be able to see it in the chrome extensions section.


## Any bug or error open an issue
