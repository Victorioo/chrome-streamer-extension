# Your favorite streamer extension.

> [!Note]
> I used the SpreenDMC profile picture, but you can change it on the manifest.json and replacing the png image.

+ I was looking for an extension that tells me when my favorite streamer is ON, 
but I didn't find it then, so i created it myself. 

+ This extension uses the Twitch API, to be able to extract the data from the streamer you choose,
you simply have to change the name and icon to the one you like the most.

## Simply to use it you must:
### 1 -  Create an app on your Twitch Console

Create an application, you can get more information on the twitch developers page.
Get your ClientID and Access Token....

### 2 - Clone the repository 

Clone the repository to have all the files, on your computer, then in the 'popup.js' file, 
you must replace the clientID and accessToken variable with your data


### 3 - Upload your extension

To upload your extension, just drag the folder with the extension in chrome://extensions and you will be able to see it in the chrome extensions section.


## Any bug or error open an issue and i will see it ✨☕
